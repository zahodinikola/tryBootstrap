                    Loren Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since
                    1500s, when an unknown printer took a gallery of type and scrambled
                    it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five cent
                    but also the leap into electronic typestting, remaining essential
                    It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
                    Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing soft
                    like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
